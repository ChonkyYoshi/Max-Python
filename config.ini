Contact_Sheet = Extracts images from Office and Story files and saves them in a contact sheet. For Powerpoint and Story files the macro will locate all slides each image is present in. Note that only images are extracted, other types of files such as videos, svg files, embedded pdf or anything that is not a jpg, jpeg or png is not extracted. The contact sheet file is named CS_<original file name>.docx

Please be aware that the macro creates a temporary file called Temp_<original file name>.docx. DO NOT DELETE IT. Please allow time for the macro to work (up to 1 or 2 minutes if the file is really long). Final file is named Bil_<original file name>.docx
