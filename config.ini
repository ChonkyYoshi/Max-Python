TopText = Welcome to Prep ToolKit!
   This utility simplifies prepping files for translation by performing operations on as many files as you want.
   Simply choose a function from the sidebar on the left, click on Browse, select all the files you want to process and click on run.
   Please make sure to read the instructions and to check the options before running.
   For questions, bug reports or feature requests please open an issue on GitHub explaining the issue in as much detail as you can.
Contact_Sheet = Extracts images from Office and Story files and saves them in a contact sheet ready to be filled out.
   For Powerpoint and Story files the script will locate all slides each image is present in.
   Sometimes, some images can fail to be inserted in the CS automatically,
   in that case the script will create a folder called Error_<original file name> and leave the affected images
   in there so you can manually check and insert them.
   You can check the "compress" option to reduce the size of the images in the CS.
   Note that the speed of the compression is reliant on how powerful your PC is. 
   The contact sheet file is named CS_<original file name>.docx
Bilingual_Table = Creates a bi-column version of a Word document.
   Already existing tables are processed first, followed by the rest of text.
   Please note that files with Track Changes WILL BREAK the script and not work properly.
   Please make sure to accept all TC before running (you can use the Accept Revisions function).
   Text outside of table will be inserted in a bicolumn table with source on the left and target on the right.
   Text inside Table will stay as one table with Source above target in each cell.
   Final file is named Bil_<original file name>.docx
Doc2PDF = Mass convert Word files to PDF files.
   You can choose to accept/reject all revisions and/or delete all comments if needed.
   Check the overwrite checkbox if also want to save the changes
   done to each source file prior to the conversion to pdf.
   Please note that overwriting IS NOT REVERSIBLE.
Accept_Revisions = Batch accept or delete revisions and/or delete all comments
   on Word files.
   By default will create a copy of each file called NoRev_<original source file name>.
   You can check the overwrite option if you want to directly edit the files.
   Please note that overwriting IS NOT REVERSIBLE.
Prep_Story = Prep Storyline Word Exports for translation.
   Hides everything but the column called Translation in all tables.
   Use the Input field in the options to use Regex to hide text during prepping.
   Note that this is an EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE, so bugs are to be excepted.
   Prepped file is saved as Prep_<original file name>
Unhide = Unhides evreything in Word, Excel and Powerpoint files.
   Make sure to check all the options to ensure the script works as you want it to.
   Please note that some shapes for Powerpoint files might not get picked up yet.
   Please open an issue on Github if you encounter this issue?
   Please note that Track Changes files and shapes (Textboxes for example) are not supported for Word yet.
ChExcel = Preflights Excel and prints the result as a JSON formatted text file.
   Report will contain the following info for each sheet:
   - Protection               - Tables
   - visibilty                - Data Validation rules
   - Hidden rows              - Cells with formulas
   - Hidden columns           - Cells with comments

   The word file contains a single bicolumn table with source on the left and target on the right.
NormalizeSpacing = Set the spacing of all shapes to 0.
   Running this usually reduce the amount of unnecessary tags in the resulting xliff substantially.
