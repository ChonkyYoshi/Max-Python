TopText = Welcome to Prep ToolKit!
   This utility simplifies prepping files for translation by performing operations on as many files as you want.
   Simply choose a function from the sidebar on the left, click on Browse, select all the files you want to process and click on run.
Contact_Sheet = Extracts images from Office and Story files and saves them in a contact sheet.
   For Powerpoint and Story files the macro will locate all slides each image is present in.
      Note that only images are extracted, other types of files such as videos, svg files, embedded pdf
      or anything that is not a jpg, jpeg or png is not extracted.
      The contact sheet file is named CS_<original file name>.docx

   Already existing tables are processed first, followed by the rest of text.
   Please be aware that the macro creates a temporary file called Temp_<original file name>.docx.
   DO NOT DELETE IT.
   Please allow time for the macro to work (up to 1 or 2 minutes if the file is really long).
   Final file is named Bil_<original file name>.docx
Doc2PDF = Mass convert Word files to PDF files.
   You can choose to accept/reject all revisions and/or delete all comments if needed.
   Check the overwrite checkbox if also want to save the changes done to each source file
   prior to the conversion to pdf.
   Please note that overwriting IS NOT REVERSIBLE.
Accept_Revisions = Batch accept or delete revisions and/or delete all comments on Word files.
   By default will create a copy of each file called NoRev_<original source file name>.
